## User Personas 

# Students and UW Faculty
    The students of University of Washington and the faculty who live
    near the campus is our target audience. The premis of this
    application is to serve as a free furniture platform to not only
    reduce the waste that builds up in Udistrict streets, but also give
    access to cost-effective resources to college students who may not
    have the funds to purchase brand new peices of furniture. Expanding
    this platform to UW faculty who live near campus gives them the
    same opportunity, as well as to post items they may no longer need
    as well and are willing to give away to those in need. Any member
    of the UW community can log onto our platform, and contact the
    "seller" through the provided contact. They can also estimate the
    location of the item to decide whether or not picking it up is
    feasible.

# City of Seattle Waste Management
    By creating this application we are helping the City of Seattle's
    Waste Management Government department reduce the amount of
    furniture waste they have to handle. Each year around move-in or
    move-out months, the excess furniture thrown on the streets because
    they do not know how to dispose of it, causes a heavier impact on
    our enviornments than they realize. During these times, the City of
    Seattle becomes responsible for handling the proper disposal of
    these items which they are often not properly disposed of or left
    on the streets for long periods of time before getting picked up.
    Overall the delayed process of clean-up hurts not only the streets
    of Udistrict, but also our local wildlife, and residental
    beautification.

# City of Seattle Residents
    By cleaning up the streets of Udistrict, we are beautifying the
    streets of Seattle. This application will prevent build-up on
    residential streets, preventing traffic blockages, and
    enviornmental harms. Residents will feel happier living in clean,
    enviornmentally friendly streets.
