** Problem Statement: **

    The UN SDG that our group aims to address is Goal 12: Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns. Each year, Americans end up throwing out more than 12 million tons of furniture (New York Times, 2023), and all of this waste ends up in landfills across the nation. Specifically, many college students end up throwing out their unused furniture upon moving out of their dorms and apartments, which begs the question: How might we reduce waste generation among college students, especially concerning the disposal or reuse of used furniture? We aim to address this problem by creating an online C2C platform where college students can post listings to give away unwanted furniture to other students in the area to avoid the build-up of littering on campus streets and in city landfills. 
    
    Potential reasons this build-up can occur that we have noted through research are that students often do not have the desire to upload their furniture to an open/un-monitored platform such as Facebook Marketplace which involves the risk of talking to a dangerous user or person that is not affiliated with the university. Another reason could be that students are not aware of transfer stations nearby, or they do not have the ability/transportation to properly dispose of their furniture when moving out. Additionally, existing furniture disposal services can be expensive and difficult to organize, especially for larger groups as many college households are. Many students also do not have furniture others would pay for, as it is often cheap and well used. 
    
    Finally, while some universities do offer end of the school year services such as Neighborhood Cleanups (UW Sustainability, 2019), these services only operate around June, leaving students with 12 month leases without access. Through this project, we aim to create safe opportunities that encourage students to preserve furniture in order to reduce waste and save money for a more sustainable future. 
    Specifically, the cause of furniture waste that we intend to address through our project is the cost barrier, by creating a platform where students can post listings of furniture that they want to get rid of and other students can respond to these listings and pick up the furniture from them and reuse it. This platform, being completely free, will motivate students to reuse their furniture and help reduce the amount of furniture that is thrown away every year as students move in and out. 
    
    In conclusion, our initiative addresses a critical aspect of UN SDG Goal 12, focusing on sustainable consumption and production patterns, specifically within the realm of furniture waste among college students. Our approach transcends solely waste reduction, it seeks to cultivate a culture of sustainability and responsible consumption among young adults. By creating a solution that is not only informational about waste reduction, but also functional, we provide students with the knowledge and tools they need to instill lifelong habits of environmental responsibility.
